# LessonsQ-A
** LESSON 1 **
1. Explain the principles of statistical quality control. What are the tools used for this purpose? Explain the principle of a control chart.

- The principles of statistical quality control (SQC) is to improve the quality of a product based on the statistics it made over time. The tools used for this purpose are: Pareto analysis, Trend Chart, Flow chart, Histogram, Scatter diagram, Control chart, Cause and effect diagram. The principles of a control chart is to be used to study how a process changes over time. Data are plotted in time order.

2.  Explain the concept of lean principles.

- The learn princple is an approach which aims to minimize the consumption of resources that added no value to a product. It identifies and eliminates waste through continuous improvement. It aims to improve production, in pursuit of perfection.

3. What is an “Ishikawa” diagram? When should the Ishikawa diagram be used? Provide a procedure to construct an Ishikawa diagram.

- An Ishikawa diagram may also be called a cause-and-effect diagram, since it depicts the effects of the 4 Ms (materials, machines, methods, and measurements) towards product quality. It should be used when we want to solve problems relating to quality control, in other words to control or improve the quality of our product. First, we should identify the 4 Ms of our subject, especially the branch causing problems. We identify “why does this happen?” then right the causes as branches from the 4 Ms. Then, from these branches, we ask again “why does this happen?” and write sub-causes. We continue doing this until we generate deeper levels of causes.

4.  What is total quality management (TQM)? What is the difference between TQM and TQC?

- Total Quality Management (TQM) is a continuous process of increasing the quality of the output by eliminating waste and the non-value adding activities in the system. TQM expresses about continuous improvement in the processes while Total Quality Control (TQC) is about maintaining the quality standards throughout the process.

5.  Explain the differences between validation and verification.

- Validation is the process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development phase to ensure that the product meets the user's needs and that the specifications were correct in the first place. On the other hand, verification is the process of evaluating work-products of a development phase to ensure that the product is being built according to the required specifications.

6. Explain the differences between failure, error, and fault.

- An error is an incorrect human action that produces an incorrect result. It may be caused by misunderstanding the system requirements, miscalculation of values, etc. Fault, also known as bug, is the manifestation of an error in software. This is the deviation of the actual behavior from the expected behavior which is identified while testing. Finally, failure is the deviation from the expected behavior to the actual behavior identified by the end user in operation.

7. What is a test case? What are the objectives of testing?

- A test case is a sample input with its expected outcome or output. There are several objectives of testing, to name a few would be to ensure that the expected outcomes are met along with its corresponding inputs, to find defects which may have been created by the programmer, or in short, to make sure that the test subject works properly as intended.

8. Explain the concepts of unit, integration, system, acceptance, and regression testing.

- During the first level, or unit testing, individual pieces of code such as classes and methods are being tested. After all units are confirmed to be working successfully, they are assembled to construct larger subsystemsby following integration testing techniques. When putting these units together that interact you need to conduct Integration testing to make sure that integrating these units together has not introduced any errors. Systemntesting comprises a number of distinct activities: creating a test plan, designing a test suite, preparing test environments, executing the tests by following a clear strategy, and monitoring the process of test execution. Regression testing is done to ensure that further changes have not broken any units that were already tested. The unit testing you already did has produced the unit tests that can be run again and again for regression testing. When the client receives the functionality, they (or your test department) will conduct Acceptance tests to ensure that the functionality meets their requirements.

9. What are the different sources from which test cases can be selected?

- The following are the different sources from which test cases can be selected: Requirements and functional specifications, Source code, Input and output domains, Operational profile, and Fault model.

10. What is the difference between fault injection and fault simulation?

- In the fault injection approach, a fault is inserted into a program, and an oracle is available to assert that the inserted fault indeed made the program incorrect. On the other hand, in fault simulation, a program modification is not guaranteed to lead to a faulty program. In fault simulation, one may modify an incorrect program and turn it into a correct program.

11. Explain the differences between structural and functional testing.

- Structural testing is considered white-box testing because knowledge of the internal logic of the system is used to develop test cases. Structural testing includes path testing, code coverage testing and analysis, logic testing, nested loop testing, and similar techniques. Unit testing, string or integration testing, load testing, stress testing, and performance testing are considered structural. On the other hand, functional testing addresses the overall behavior of the program by testing transaction flows, input validation, and functional completeness. Functional testing is considered black-box testing because no knowledge of the internal logic of the system is used to develop test cases. System testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing are types of functional testing.

12. What are the strengths and weaknesses of automated testing and manual testing?

- Automated testing is good to use in large projects. It runs tests quickly and effectively, cost effective in the long run, and allows for better team collaboration. Though along with these strengths are the following weaknesses: the tools may be expensive, and the limitations they have such as visual considerations. On the other hand, manual testing is a good fit for smaller projects as well as companies without significant financial resources. Its short term cost is lower, more likely to find real user issues, and is flexible. Cons: there are certain actions that are difficult to do manually, can be repetetive and boring.
